# SpellCheck
SpellCheck is another program I completed in school. Essentially, this program will take a word the user enters and spell checks it. The way it spell checks was by using a text file with a list of common (english) words. The technical way that it is done is using hashing and LLs to enter the words into the hash table, with the word the user enters being put through the hash table where a similar word will be found. This is done using pword, and changing each letter within the word the user enters to each lowercase letter of the alphabet. This is done to find the correct spelling of the word (if it exists). If the correct spelling is found, nothing will happen.
